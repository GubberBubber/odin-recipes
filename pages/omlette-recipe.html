    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you are a huge fan of ranch dressing like I am, than you are going to fall in love with these chicken and ranch wraps. They are extremely easy to make and can be prepared ahead of time for work or meal prep.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Oil:</em> To coat the pan you can use oil or butter.</li>
        <li><em>Salt and Pepper:</em> A pinch of kosher salt does wonderful things for the egg mixture - from seasoning the eggs just right to creating an even fluffier texture.</li>
        <li><em>Eggs:</em> Just 2 large eggs are needed for cooking up the perfect omelette with an 8-inch pan. If you've got a 10-inch pan, 3 eggs are ideal.</li>
        <li><em>Filling:</em> The world is your oyster when it comes to omelette fillings! My go-to is a bell pepper, spinach combo with a sprinkle of microgreens on top. But I've got tons more deliciously savory ideas listed out below.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Saute the filling. Before you actually make the omelette, you'll need to saute your choice of filling. Then set the filling aside on a separate plate.</li>
        <li>Make the egg base. Whisk the eggs, salt and pepper in a medium bowl until lightly fluffy.</li>
        <li>Cook the omelette base. The key to the perfect omelette is cooking low and slow! So heat the oil or butter over medium-low heat, then pour the egg mixture into an even layer. Turn the heat to low, and let it cook without poking or prodding for 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add in the good stuff. Pile the filling onto one side of the omelette. Then gently fold the other half over and slowly slide the omelette onto a plate. Breakfast is served! </li>
    </ol>
